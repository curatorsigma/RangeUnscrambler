# RangeUnscrambler

This Python-Script was build and tested using python 3.6.5.

Calculate what dice to roll for the results to fill a given range.


You can generate a random number for your intervall if you do not want to physically roll. Press r after the result is shown.

You can switch to verbose mode with v. The verbose mode shows Standard Deviation as well as Expectation value for the result.

You can disable Solutions like "Roll 1d100, reroll 67 and higher" with p.

*Note that about 5.5% of randomly chosen Intervals will not successfully be resolved. Instead a random Integer is created inside the given Interval.*
